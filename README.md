# FED Interview Challenge 

Notes on this challenge:

Hello! Thanks for the consideration and for this cool opportunity to test my React knowledge. I had a lot of fun working on this.
 
I implemented a few extra tasks since I had time:
  I did all three of these rather than just one:
    * Animate and fade in hero text
    * Animate cards in the grid section on hover
    * Animate and fade in cards in the iFit-enabled equipment section, when in view.
  I did two of the JavaScript tasks as well:
    * Create a functioning reviews slider (repeating the reviews is acceptable)
    * Set up the language picker in the footer to "select" different languages (display a list of languages and replace the label when clicked)
  And I made a few small tasks of my own:
    * Responsiveness improvements - collapse main navbar into hamburger menu, reduce padding for smaller screens
    * Fade-in animation on the whole page

Ordinarily I'd write tests, but since this challenge was mostly centered around styling / static design, I figured the tests would be largely redundant. I do think testing is important though! If you click around my Github you'll see plenty of samples of other tests I've written with Jest / Enzyme / React-testing-library, like right [here](https://github.com/dallinw/react-code-test/blob/master/src/App.test.tsx).


# Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
